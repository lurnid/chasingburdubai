                    Hi! I'm Ekta Saran and I'd like to welcome you to this little project that I started.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chasing Bur Dubai is a personal portrait of the Dubai that I know. The Dubai that I grew up in. Before the infamous skyline, before Sheikh Zayed Road, before everything moved up South, the streets and alleys of this world was all I knew.

                    The aim of the project is to make a series of short films about the heros of Bur Dubai. The
                    people who have, each in their own way, made a mark on their community.

                    Chasing Bur Dubai aims to capture their stories in short 3 to 5 minute films. I have made 2
                    films already and have ideas lined up for X more at the moment
                    I have set up a Patreon account
